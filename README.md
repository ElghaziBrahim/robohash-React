# Robohash React App

Welcome to the Robohash React App! This application allows you to generate unique robot avatars (Robohashes) for users. It comes with two main features: finding existing users and adding new users.

## Features

### 1. Find User

The "Find User" feature enables you to search for existing users and view their corresponding Robohash avatars. Simply enter the username of the user you're looking for, and the application will fetch and display the associated robot avatar.

### 2. Add User

The "Add User" feature allows you to create new users and generate custom Robohash avatars for them. Enter the desired username, and the app will automatically create a unique robot avatar based on the provided username.

## Technologies Used

- React JS: The frontend of the application is built using React, providing a fast and interactive user experience.
